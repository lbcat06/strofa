# strofa
A tui music player for mpd written in Rust

## motivation
I've been using mpd for a while now, but found that the go-to ncmpcpp didn't satisfy my general-use flow (it is still really powerful and I still use it for tag editing and such, and it's definitely an inspiration for strofa). While using ncmpcpp for a while, I stumbled upon spotify-tui which seemed to really tick all my boxes for a tui music player, it was also made in Rust, my preferred language and I thought that's enough to get me going on making my own "spotify-tui" for mpd.

## the meaning of `strofa`
